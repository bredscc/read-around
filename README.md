# ReadAround 

**ReadAround** Is a **Python** automation project that randomly selects a country and recommends a classic book from its literary tradition. Data is managed in **JSON** and results are displayed on a static site hosted with GitHub Pages. Born from a personal goal to read more internationally.

## Features
- Python script to generate and manage the dataset (`countries_books.json`).
- Static website styled with **Bootstrap**.
