# ReadAround 

**ReadAround** is a playful project that combines **Python**, **JSON**, and a **static website** powered by **GitHub Pages**.  
It lets you randomly pick a country and discover emblematic books from that country, like traveling the world through literature.

## 🚀 Features
- Python script to generate and manage the dataset (`countries_books.json`).
- Static website styled with **Bootstrap**.
- A "Pick a Country" button that randomly selects a country and displays book suggestions.
- Extensible JSON data structure: you can easily add more countries and books.
